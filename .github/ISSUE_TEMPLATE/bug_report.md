This is the repository of Mo' Creatures Extended exclusively for 1.12.2 and is not affiliated with other forks or other unofficial ports of Mo' Creatures. Please do not report any bugs originating from other forks or unofficial ports of Mo' Creatures, they will immediately be closed and marked as invalid.

If you are making an issue regarding entity spawns, please attempt the following before reporting:

1. Adjust the frequency values inside `MoCreatures.cfg`.
2. Utilize the Spawn Caps tweak in [Universal Tweaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/universal-tweaks) to further increase entity spawn caps.
3. If you are playing with other mods that add entities and they are not spawning, you will most likely have to adjust their weights using a mod like [BiomeTweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/biometweaker) because of how vanilla's weight system works.
4. Be sure to mess around with the `World Gen Spawning Creatures` and `World Gen Spawning Water Creatures` config options inside `MoCSettings.cfg`.
